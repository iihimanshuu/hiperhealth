## 1. Key Information

You are being asked to allow the use of your health information for research.
Before you decide, please read this form carefully and ask any questions you may
have. Your participation is completely voluntary.

---

## 2. Purpose of the Research

The purpose of this research is to improve understanding of health conditions
and care delivery by analyzing de-identified patient data. Your data may help
develop better tools, treatments, and technologies for patients in the future.

---

## 3. Procedures

If you agree:

- Researchers will use data already collected as part of your care.
- No additional tests or visits are required.
- **HIPAA de-identification categories:**
  - **De-identified under HIPAA §164.514(b):** Not PHI; no Authorization
    required.
  - **Limited Data Set (LDS) under HIPAA §164.514(e):** External disclosures for
    research, public health, or health care operations require a Data Use
    Agreement (DUA); Authorization or waiver is not required for those purposes;
    institutional/IRB approvals may still apply.
  - **Identifiable PHI:** Requires your HIPAA Authorization or an IRB/Privacy
    Board–approved waiver of Authorization.
  - **Note:** “Coded”/pseudonymized data that can be re-identified by the holder
    remain PHI under HIPAA.
- Data may be shared with approved research partners or institutions under
  strict confidentiality agreements and Data Use Agreements where applicable.
- Only authorized personnel will access your information.

## 4. Risks and Discomforts

There are no physical risks to you. Although every effort will be made to
protect your privacy, there is a small risk that someone could identify you from
shared data.

**Security measures:**

- Data will be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Access is role-based (least privilege), logged, and audited.
- Regular security assessments are performed.

---

## 5. Benefits

There may be no direct benefit to you. However, your data may help researchers
advance medical knowledge, improve diagnostic tools, or develop better
treatments.

---

## 6. Confidentiality and Data Protection

We take your privacy seriously and will implement strict safeguards to protect
your information.

- **De-identification:** Personal identifiers (e.g., name, address) will be
  removed or replaced with a study code.
- **Data retention:** Data will be retained for an undetermined period, or for a
  maximum of 10 years, then securely destroyed or archived in de-identified
  form.
- **Access control:** Only authorized personnel will access your information.
  Access is role-based (least privilege), logged, and audited.
- **Data security:** Data will be encrypted in transit and at rest. Regular
  security assessments are performed.
- **Data sharing:** Data may be shared with approved research partners or
  institutions under strict confidentiality agreements and Data Use Agreements
  where applicable.
- **International transfers:** Transfers of data outside your country will
  follow appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, Transfer
  Impact Assessment). Participants can request copies.
- **Compliance:** All use of your information will comply with applicable
  privacy laws (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
- **Sensitive information:** Agreements with research partners may be partially
  redacted to protect confidential or commercially sensitive information.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Despite these measures, there is a small risk that someone could
> identify you from shared data.
